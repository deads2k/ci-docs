# Clusters

The clusters that currently comprise CI are:

* [api.ci](https://console.svc.ci.openshift.org/): legacy Openshift 3.11 cluster in GCP. Job execution is being migrated out of it.
* [app.ci](https://console-openshift-console.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/): Openshift Dedicated 4.x cluster containing most Prow services including registry.ci.openshift.org (our image registry for CI builds).
* [build01](https://console.build01.ci.openshift.org/): Openshift 4.x cluster in AWS that executes a growing subset of the jobs.
* [build02](https://console.build02.ci.openshift.org/): Openshift 4.x cluster in GCP that executes a growing subset of the jobs.
* `vsphere`: external cluster used for vSphere tests, not managed by DPTP.

Except for `vsphere`, these clusters use Github OAuth authentication: all members of the Openshift organization in Github can log in.
